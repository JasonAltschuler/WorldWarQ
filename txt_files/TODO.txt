NOTE: PLEASE DON'T DELETE TASKS WHEN YOU COMPLETE THEM. JUST MOVE THEM TO THE SECOND CATEGORY!


/// =================== TODO ================ ///

capture video for realistic and non realistic thrust/turn (easy vs. hard mode). perhaps after trails

add sound effects when firing bullets.
note: you may need to modify the code that uses randomnumbers to shoot at the proper rate.
      we want the stream of bullets to be constant, so the gun sound will be good.

test bullets and basic AI by having a turret on the ground shoot up at the plane

Add animation on collision and respawning

screen maximized and look good

(UI: Add radar/minimap?)
leading crosshair for targeting

AI:
Create computer-controlled aircraft

Terrain:
Landscape auto-creation and texture mapping


At the end: remove some of the R3Aircraft.AssertValid() and R3Intersection.AssertValid() calls to speed up

/// =================== completed tasks below ================ ///

// Done on Saturday, the 10th
Added alternative viewpoint: look backwards (toggle with '5') -- useful for debugging AI
Added aircraft5.scn, aircraft6.scn, aircraft7.scn for debugging (read descriptions at top of files for more)
Implemented HP for airplanes (parameter in scene files)
Implemented bullet collision with airplanes
Able to load more than 1 plane in the scene at a time

// Done on Friday, the 9th
Added skybox   

// Done on Thurdsay, the 8th
Put thrust percentage, velocity (* 40 mph), etc. on left 
Put static shooter cross hairs on viewpoint 3 (and possibly viewpoint 2 too)

// Done on Wednesday, the 7th
Made meshes be triangles so collisions now work

// Done on Monday, the 5th
Add projectiles (bullets)
Add trails (hide particle source, then put out particles with lifetime 1 second or something
    and no velocity) with trails
Make toggle-able viewpoint from nose of aircraft
Make toggle-able viewpoint from above the aircraft
Make turning more realistic


// Done on Sunday, the 4th
Add controls for thrust and brake (-thrust)
Update aircraft's velocity with drag and thrust (and added to scene file specification) (and terminal velocity)
Figure out why the vectors are still at 0, 0, 0 (relevant for visualization)
Create mesh (use raw meshview --> rotate and scale (1.75) and center it to 0, 0, 0). 


// Done on Saturday, the 3rd
Draw a point
  Draw a mesh

User input
  View pitch/yaw
  Vectors visible
    Pitch/yaw correct

Use position to create original transform
