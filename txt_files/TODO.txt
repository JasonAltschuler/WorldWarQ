/// =================== TODO ================ ///

Additional stuff for fun:
make leading crosshairs for planes
make black particles when injured
flash crosshairs when enemies are hit
attempt realistic physics (lift, gravity)


Kyle:
Make 2-5 min video of gameplay. Put at top of writeup.
Make interesting scenes

Daway:
Add tags to scene (5 minutes)


Everyone:
Work on presentation
SUBMIT



/// =================== TODO IF EXTRA TIME ================ ///


Make flying more realistic



At the end: remove some of the R3Aircraft.AssertValid() and R3Intersection.AssertValid() calls to speed up


//////  ============== capture videos of ================= ///////

capture video for realistic and non realistic thrust/turn (easy vs. hard mode). perhaps after trails


/// =================== completed tasks below ================ ///

// Done on Monday, the 12th
Fix camera view
Head-sup display: death, kill, hit
Background music for gameplay
Changed name for game
Improved AI
Multiple skyboxes / textures
Clip stuff on minimap
Create minimap
AI doesn't shoot when dead. Bullets don't collide when dead 
Trails as lines for bullets
screen maximized and look good
Add more sounds (for thrust)



// Done on Sunday, the 11th
Explosions have gravity (on particles)
3D sound
Terrain: Landscape auto-creation and texture mapping
note: you may need to modify the code that uses randomnumbers to shoot at the proper rate.
      we want the stream of bullets to be constant, so the gun sound will be good.
Make aircraft explode when destroyed by bullets, when crash into mesh, and when crash into other planes
made bullets more constant (more realistic for machine guns)
added kills / deaths to HUD
added textures
add sound effects when firing bullets.
Make trails interpolate between material_color and black, not white and black
Change color of explosion

// Done on Saturday, the 10th
Create AI / computer-controlled aircraft
Add animation on aircraft explosion
Added alternative viewpoint: look backwards (toggle with '5') -- useful for debugging AI
Added aircraft5.scn, aircraft6.scn, aircraft7.scn for debugging (read descriptions at top of files for more)
Implemented respawning for enemy planes
Implemented HP for airplanes (parameter in scene files)
Implemented bullet collision with airplanes
Able to load more than 1 plane in the scene at a time

// Done on Friday, the 9th
Added skybox   

// Done on Thurdsay, the 8th
Put thrust percentage, velocity (* 40 mph), etc. on left 
Put static shooter cross hairs on viewpoint 3 (and possibly viewpoint 2 too)

// Done on Wednesday, the 7th
Made meshes be triangles so collisions now work

// Done on Monday, the 5th
Add projectiles (bullets)
Add trails (hide particle source, then put out particles with lifetime 1 second or something
    and no velocity) with trails
Make toggle-able viewpoint from nose of aircraft
Make toggle-able viewpoint from above the aircraft
Make turning more realistic


// Done on Sunday, the 4th
Add controls for thrust and brake (-thrust)
Update aircraft's velocity with drag and thrust (and added to scene file specification) (and terminal velocity)
Figure out why the vectors are still at 0, 0, 0 (relevant for visualization)
Create mesh (use raw meshview --> rotate and scale (1.75) and center it to 0, 0, 0). 


// Done on Saturday, the 3rd
Draw a point
  Draw a mesh

User input
  View pitch/yaw
  Vectors visible
    Pitch/yaw correct

Use position to create original transform
