NOTE: PLEASE DON'T DELETE TASKS WHEN YOU COMPLETE THEM. JUST MOVE THEM TO THE SECOND CATEGORY!


/// =================== TODO ================ ///

capture video for realistic and non realistic thrust/turn (easy vs. hard mode). perhaps after trails

Make camera on top of plane
Make a thing to toggle whether camera from top or from normal camera viewpoint (1, 2, 3, 4 to toggle)


Add trails (hide particle source, then put out particles with lifetime 1 second or something
    and no velocity) with trails

Add projectiles (bullets)



-------

Landscape auto-creation and texture mapping





/// =================== completed tasks below ================ ///

// Done on Monday, the 5th
Made turning more realistic


// Done on Sunday, the 4th
Add controls for thrust and brake (-thrust)
Update aircraft's velocity with drag and thrust (and added to scene file specification) (and terminal velocity)
Figure out why the vectors are still at 0, 0, 0 (relevant for visualization)
Create mesh (use raw meshview --> rotate and scale (1.75) and center it to 0, 0, 0). 


// Done on Saturday, the 3rd
Draw a point
  Draw a mesh

User input
